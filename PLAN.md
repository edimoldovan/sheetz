# Sheetz roadmap

Guiding principle: build features in the order people actually use a
spreadsheet. Roughly 90% of the time goes on formatting, navigation, basic
formulas, sort/filter and charts — that's v0.2–v0.4. Pivot tables and
automation are the long tail.

"IC" notes what the IronCalc engine already provides vs. what we build.

## Architecture (done)

- [x] **Split the monolith** — `engine.rs` (all IronCalc access, plain-typed
      API), `state.rs` (app state), `app.rs` (update loop + command dispatch),
      `ui/{grid,ribbon,editor,dialogs,charts}.rs`. UI never imports ironcalc.
- [x] **Command registry** — ~100 named commands, every one bindable.
- [x] **Keymap** — the full standard set in `keymap.toml`, plus an in-app
      shortcut viewer (F1).

## v0.2 — Looks like a spreadsheet (formatting & structure)

- [x] **Render cell styles** — bold/italic/underline/strike, font size, text
      and fill color, borders, horizontal + vertical alignment.
- [x] **Edit basic styles** — ribbon Home group with live toggle states.
- [x] **Number format UI** — General, currency, percent, comma, date,
      increase/decrease decimals.
- [x] **Insert/delete rows & columns** — with reference adjustment (IC).
- [x] **Autofit column width** — double-click or ribbon.
- [x] **Right-click context menu** — cut/copy/paste, insert/delete, clear,
      format.
- [x] **Sheet management** — new, rename (double-click tab), delete,
      duplicate, reorder.
- [x] **Clear** — contents / formats / all.
- [x] **Column/row resize by dragging** header edges, with resize cursors and
      double-click-to-autofit; header click/drag selects whole rows/columns.
- [x] **Merged cells** — existing merges render as one cell and select as a
      unit. *Creating* merges is blocked upstream: IronCalc exposes merged
      regions for reading only.
- [x] **Freeze panes** — frozen rows/columns painted as a pinned overlay with
      a stronger boundary line, and reported in the status bar.

## v0.3 — Edits like a spreadsheet should (clipboard, fill, find)

- [x] **Formula-aware clipboard** — internal copy/paste keeps formulas, styles
      and adjusts relative references; cut marks the source; external apps
      still get TSV (IC).
- [x] **Paste values only** — Ctrl+Shift+V.
- [x] **Enter-mode vs Edit-mode** — typing then arrow commits and moves; F2
      then arrow moves the caret.
- [x] **Find & Replace** — Ctrl+F/H, match case, all-sheets, find next/prev,
      replace all.
- [x] **Undo/redo** — covers edits, styles, structure (IC history).
- [x] **Fill handle** — the drag-corner on the selection, with a preview
      outline; fills down/right through the engine's series logic.
- [x] **F4 reference cycling** — A1 → $A$1 → A$1 → $A1 while editing.
- [x] **Click-to-reference while editing a formula**, with each distinct
      reference in the formula given its own highlight color.

## v0.4 — Works with data (sort, filter, formulas UX)

- [x] **Sort** — ascending/descending on the selection or surrounding block,
      with header detection; plus a sort dialog.
- [x] **Named ranges** — name manager (add/list/delete).
- [x] **Go To** — Ctrl+G / F5 and a working Name Box.
- [x] **Selection stats** — Sum / Average / Count in the status bar.
- [x] **AutoFilter** — header dropdown buttons opening a searchable value
      checklist; non-matching rows are hidden.
- [x] **Formula autocomplete** — function-name popup while typing, Up/Down to
      choose, Tab/Enter to accept.
- [x] **Multi-key sort** — up to three levels, ascending/descending each,
      blanks last.
- [ ] **Data validation** — dropdown lists first
- [ ] **Multi-range selection** — Ctrl+click disjoint ranges

## v0.5 — Shows data (visual layer)

- [x] **Conditional formatting** — cell-value rules and color scales via a
      dialog; rendering comes through the engine's extended styles, so rules
      loaded from a real .xlsx paint correctly too.
- [x] **Charts (native)** — bar / line / pie drawn with the egui painter in
      floating windows over the sheet.
- [x] **Zoom** — Ctrl+scroll, ribbon buttons, status-bar readout.
- [x] **Toggle gridlines**.
- [x] **Data bars** — painted behind cell text from the engine's evaluated
      conditional formatting.
- [ ] **Charts in xlsx** — reading/writing chart XML so charts survive a round
      trip; native charts are view-only today
- [ ] **Comments/notes**, **hyperlinks**

## v0.6 — LLM-operable, live (MCP)

The goal: a non-technical person talks to Claude/GPT ("log that I applied to
Acme today", "which applications haven't replied in two weeks?") and watches
their real spreadsheet update in front of them. The assistant maintains the
file over months; the human stays in control and can always undo.

That rules out a headless server: the model edits **the workbook already open
in the GUI**, and every change is visible immediately.

### Transport — the live bridge

**Requirement: launching Sheetz normally — from the desktop launcher, a file
manager, anywhere — is the only step.** No terminal, no flag, no separate
daemon to remember. A CLI entry point may exist, but nothing may *depend* on
the user typing it.

MCP clients launch a server and speak newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over
stdio, so the running GUI can't be the server directly (its stdio isn't the
client's). Hence a socket the GUI always holds, plus a shim that bridges to it.

- [x] **Socket server starts with the app, unconditionally** — spawned during
      startup, not behind a flag or subcommand, so a launcher start is fully
      equivalent to a terminal start.
- [x] **Socket path and liveness** — `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/sheetz.sock`, falling
      back to `/tmp/sheetz-$UID.sock` (a launcher's environment is thinner than
      a shell's, so nothing may assume shell-only variables). On startup, try
      connecting to an existing socket first: if it answers, another instance
      is primary and this one serves nothing; if it refuses, the file is stale
      — unlink and bind. Remove it on clean exit.
- [x] **Commands marshalled onto the UI thread** — the socket thread sends a
      request plus a reply channel; `update()` drains the queue, applies it to
      the `Engine` and replies. `Context::request_repaint()` (Send + Sync) wakes
      the loop, so edits land even while the app sits idle.
- [x] **`sheetz mcp` stdio shim** — the tiny binary the MCP client launches.
      Proxies stdio to the socket; if nothing is listening it starts the GUI
      itself and waits for the socket, so an assistant-first flow works too.
- [x] Protocol layer: `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, tool
      failures as `isError` results rather than protocol errors. Hand-rolled,
      no framework (the shape is proven in viode's `viode-mcp`).
- [x] Tests covering the protocol surface: schemas, initialize, tools/list,
      notifications, malformed input, and tool failures arriving as `isError`
      results. The socket and GUI halves are exercised by driving the real
      binary with an MCP client script.

### Registration — the other half of "no terminal commands"

A running socket is useless if the assistant doesn't know Sheetz exists.
Registering an MCP server normally means hand-editing a client's JSON config,
which is precisely the step being ruled out — so Sheetz does it:

- [x] **Installer registers the server** — `packaging/install.sh` adds the
      `sheetz` entry (pointing at `sheetz mcp`) to the MCP client configs it
      finds, merging into existing JSON rather than overwriting it, and
      leaving a backup.
- [x] **In-app "Connect to assistant"** — a File/backstage action that does the
      same registration on demand and reports what it wrote, for people who
      installed some other way or added a client later. This is the path a
      non-technical user actually takes.
- [x] **Status readout** — the backstage shows whether the socket is listening,
      whether this instance is the primary, and which clients are registered,
      so "why can't Claude see my sheet?" is answerable without a terminal.
- [x] `.mcp.json` in the repo for development use.
- [x] **Registration happens at app startup** — running Sheetz is genuinely the
      only requirement. No installer step, no `register` command needed, no
      hand-edited JSON. Idempotent: once the entry is right nothing is
      rewritten, key order is preserved and a `.bak` is kept.
- [x] **A skill teaching the tools** — `~/.claude/skills/sheetz/SKILL.md`,
      written at startup like the registration. Tool schemas say what the
      arguments are; the skill says how to *work*: look before writing, prefer
      records over coordinates, write formulas not constants, and leave undo,
      backups, autosave and confirmations to Sheetz. The same guidance goes out
      condensed as MCP `initialize` instructions, so clients without skills
      still get it.

### Tools the assistant needs

Raw cell addressing is not enough — asking a model to compute "row 14, column
D" is where it will make mistakes. Sheets that hold records get record-shaped
tools on top of the cell-level ones.

- [x] **Discovery** — `workbook_info` (sheets, used ranges, dirty state, path),
      `sheet_read` returning a *window* with values and optionally formulas.
      Hard cap the cell count and default to the used range; a naive
      "read the sheet" on a million rows must be impossible.
- [x] **Cell level** — `cell_set`, `range_set`, `range_format`,
      `rows_insert/delete`, `cols_insert/delete`, `sheet_add/rename/delete` —
      one-liners over `engine.rs`.
- [x] **Record level** — treat a header row as a schema: `table_schema`,
      `table_append(record)`, `table_find(criteria)`, `table_update(match,
      changes)`. This is what makes "mark the Acme application as rejected"
      reliable instead of a guess about coordinates.
- [x] **Templates** — `workbook_from_template("job-applications" | "budget" |
      …)`: headers, formats, freeze, filter, a couple of summary formulas. Gets
      a useful file existing in one turn.
- [x] **Query** — `stats`, `find`, `sort_range`, `filter` so the model can
      answer questions without dragging the whole sheet into its context.

### Trust, safety and visibility

The point of doing this in a visible GUI is that the human stays in the loop.

- [x] **Change highlighting** — cells the assistant just wrote get a temporary
      tint that fades, so you can see what it touched at a glance.
- [x] **Activity log** — a side panel listing each tool call in plain English
      ("added row 12: Acme, Applied, 2026-08-30"), with the range it touched.
- [x] **One tool call = one undo step** — done at the app layer: the engine
      counts the undo entries a batch produced and `undo_grouped` pops them
      together. IronCalc keeps its history private with no grouping API, so
      collapsing them *inside* the engine stays blocked upstream.
- [x] **Destructive operations gated** — deleting sheets, clearing ranges or
      overwriting non-empty blocks prompt for confirmation in the UI (or are
      refused in an unattended mode). The model must not be able to quietly
      destroy a year of records.
- [x] **Edit conflicts** — refuse (with a clear error the model can act on)
      while the user has a cell editor open, rather than yanking it away.
- [x] **Save policy** — debounced autosave after assistant edits, since the
      target user will not think to press Ctrl+S; explicit `workbook_save` too,
      and never silently discard the human's unsaved work.
- [x] **Backups** — keep the previous version alongside the file before the
      first assistant write of a session. Cheap insurance for a file someone
      maintains for months.

### Engine gaps this needs first

- [x] Make `parse_a1_range` public — tools should take `"B2:D9"`, not integers.
- [x] `read_range` returning a value grid in one call.
- [x] Sheet lookup by name, since tools take names and the engine takes indices.
- [x] Transaction begin/end around a batch of edits — batches the recalc (one
      evaluation per tool call) and counts undo steps for the grouping above.

## v0.7+ — The long tail

- [ ] **Pivot tables** — read existing first, then create/edit
- [ ] **Print / export PDF** — page setup, print areas
- [ ] **Images in sheets**
- [ ] **Workbook protection**
- [ ] **Goal seek**
- [ ] **Scripting** — an embedded Rust scripting language (Rhai), not a
      macro language clone. Explicit non-goal until the above ships.

## Engine parity track (continuous, upstream)

IronCalc implements a large subset of the ~500 standard functions. As we hit gaps
(XLOOKUP, dynamic arrays/spill, LAMBDA, …):

1. Log the missing function in an issue here,
2. Implement it **upstream in IronCalc** and pull the release — everyone wins
   and we don't fork the engine.

Same for xlsx fidelity bugs and for the missing merge-cells write API.

## App infrastructure track (continuous)

- [x] Unit tests for A1 parsing, column names, jump-to-edge, replace; xlsx
      round-trip integration test.
- [ ] Per-frame cell format cache (the grid currently queries the engine per
      visible cell per frame)
- [ ] Packaging: `.desktop` file + icon, AUR PKGBUILD, release CI
- [ ] Chorded/multi-key bindings in the keymap

## Explicit non-goals

Macro-language compatibility, query/ETL tooling, real-time collaboration,
cloud sync, an add-in ecosystem. These are incumbent-ecosystem moats, not
spreadsheet
features; chasing them kills the project. KISS.
